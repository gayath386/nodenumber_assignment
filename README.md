# nodenumber_assignment
Simple code for assigning node numbers to locations of nodes in the source and destination
This code is particularly useful for plotting graphs wherein we have only the source and destinatin [x,y] locations. In this code, the source and destination [x,y] locations are given to 2 variables (Data_1 and Data_2). The source locations are indexed and the corresponding indexes are used for finding the nodes in destination nodes.As these are in order, the resulting varibales can be used for plotting graphs.
